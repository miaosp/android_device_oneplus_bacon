# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for grouper hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps).
#

# Sample: This is where we'd set a backup provider if we had one
# $(call inherit-product, device/sample/products/backup_overlay.mk)


# Inherit from the common Open Source product configuration
$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/full_base_telephony.mk)

# Inherit from hardware-specific part of the product configuration
$(call inherit-product, device/oneplus/bacon/device.mk)

# Discard inherited values and use our own instead.
